## Internship Experience

Splunk, (USA)\
Machine Learning Applied Scientist Intern\
Collaborative Open-Source Agents for Enhancing Chain of Thought Reasoning Quality of SPL: Developed a method that LLM open-source agents collaborate to enhance CoT better than GPT4. Specifically, there are N LLM generators, one relative grader for Chain of Thought (COT) grading, and N iterative improvement agents for improving CoT quality. We tried different models like llama3 8B, phi3, gemma2 9B, and Llama3 70B. Our final score shows that we use open-source models to achieve results better than GPT-4o.

MultiPlan, (USA)\
AI Research Intern - Applied Large Language Models \
Large Language Model Design: According to Meta’s large language model diplomatic game Cicero, designing
our own large language model diplomatic game (need to modify input, output, and model structure).\
Pricing Recommendation: Design a recommendation system using contextual bandits and the ClaimtoVec model to
do pricing recommendations for three phases: Prepay, Postpay, Arbitration\
TextoSQL: Fine-tuning a large language model(T5) on our own dataset on problem question(text) to SQL.
